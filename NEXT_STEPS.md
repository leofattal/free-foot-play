# Next Steps - Free Foot Play

Your Free Foot Play application foundation has been successfully set up! Here's what to do next to get it running.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Set Up Supabase (5-10 minutes)

You **must** complete this step before the app will work:

1. **Create a Supabase account** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Create a new project** (choose a region close to you)
3. **Get your API credentials**:
   - Go to Settings > API in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key
4. **Update `.env.local`** with your credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key-here
   ```
5. **Run the database schema**:
   - Open the SQL Editor in Supabase
   - Copy all contents from `supabase/schema.sql`
   - Paste and run it

### 2. Test the Application (5 minutes)

```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

**Quick Test Checklist**:
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Click "Sign Up" and create a test account
- [ ] Check email for confirmation (or skip if disabled in Supabase)

## Development Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Start with data flow**:
   - Always fetch data on server components when possible
   - Use client components only for interactivity
   - Keep forms in client components

2. **Use the existing patterns**:
   - Look at the dashboard page for Supabase data fetching
   - Look at auth pages for form handling
   - Reuse Tailwind utility classes from globals.css

3. **Test as you go**:
   - Create test data in Supabase
   - Test on mobile sizes (responsive design)
   - Test with multiple users

### Helpful Code Snippets

#### Fetch Data from Supabase (Server Component)
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';

const supabase = await createClient();
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('*')
  .eq('column', 'value');
```

#### Create Data (Client Component)
```typescript
'use client';
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client';

const supabase = createClient();
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .insert({ field: 'value' });
```

#### Protected Page (Server Component)
```typescript
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';

const supabase = await createClient();
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

if (!user) {
  redirect('/auth/login');
}
```

## Recommended Development Order

1. **Week 1**: Set up Supabase, test authentication, add sample match data
2. **Week 2**: Build child profile management (add/edit/delete)
3. **Week 3**: Build match listing page with filters
4. **Week 4**: Implement match registration flow
5. **Week 5**: Add field information page and contact form
6. **Week 6**: Polish UI, fix bugs, prepare for launch
